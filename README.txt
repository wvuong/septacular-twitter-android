What is this:
This was my very first Android program with the Android 2.3 SDK in 2010.  It did work but was never published to the Market.  I have no idea if it still works post-Mavenization.  Also, Septa changed their Regional Rail names so it probably broke the program.

You would "subscribe" to a particular Septa Twitter feed (http://www.septa.org/alert/twitter.html) and then you would receive notifications when the feed updated.

The code hasn't been updated since 2010.

To do:
Update to use new Regional Rail feeds
Update to use push notifications
Update to latest Android SDK
Update to latest Maven + deps
